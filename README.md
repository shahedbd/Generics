# Generics Overview: C#

1. Use generic types to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance.
2. The most common use of generics is to create collection classes. <br /> 
3. The .NET Framework class library contains several new generic collection classes in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. These should be used whenever possible instead of classes such as ArrayList in the System.Collections namespace. <br /> 
4. You can create your own generic interfaces, classes, methods, events and delegates. <br /> 
5. Generic classes may be constrained to enable access to methods on particular data types. <br /> 
6. Information on the types that are used in a generic data type may be obtained at run-time by using reflection. <br />
